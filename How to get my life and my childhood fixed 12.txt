How to get my life and my childhood fixed:

1. Change my life:
Step 1: Change your attitude
Step 2: Change your mind
Step 3: Change your style

2. Change my childhood:
Step 1: Become a fan and like and 
love non-Butch Hartman cartoons except 
for the old Fairly OddParents episodes

3. Never use the internet ever again
Step 1: Only go on the following websites:
Trademarkia
Google Maps
Wikipedia
Step 2: Only see mommy use it or something like that.

4. Never go anywhere else except for school/homeschool
Step 1: Do not go with Daddy anymore
Step 2: Only go with mommy to haircut, store or school 
without getting offended. Try not to.

5. Pretend like all of this did not happen:
Step 1: Pretend like Trump is NOT President. Just pretend like Obama is still president.
Step 2: Pretend like Sausage Party wasn't made and never existed.
Step 3: Pretend like the Fairly OddParents didn't go downhill after celebrating it's 15th anniversary.
Step 4: Pretend like everything is in 2004-2011
Step 5: Pretend like all of this did not happen!

6. Understand and learn
Step 1: Go through these flashcards as many times as you want.
Step 2: You can also use TTS, Burn onto CD and listen or listen on PC after making TTS.wav
Step 3: Remove and ignore any pictures/videos you 
don't like by putting them on a private folder 
that you don't want to click on!

One more thing..
The only videos you can make from now on are your own TTS videos you loved to make inspired after the Drew Pickles go to videos.
Also, do NOT destroy your PC and do not break it and do not leave it on all day in some days.

Hope this helped me! That's how!
